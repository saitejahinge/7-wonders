    <p> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal">Taj Mahal</a>(/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ -/ TAHJ mə-HAHL,
        TAHZH -⁠; Hindustani: [taːdʒ ˈmɛɦ(ɛ)l]; lit. 'Crown of the
        Palace') is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India.
        It
        was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658), to house the tomb of his
        beloved
        wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare
        (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three
        sides by
        a crenellated wall.</p>

    <p>The history of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China">Great Wall of China</a> began when
        fortifications built by various states during the Spring and
        Autumn (771–476 BC)[1] and Warring States periods (475–221 BC) were connected by the first emperor of China, Qin
        Shi Huang, to protect his newly founded Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) against incursions by nomads from Inner Asia.
        The walls were built of rammed earth, constructed using forced labour, and by 212 BC ran from Gansu to the coast
        of southern Manchuria.</p>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra">Petra</a> (Arabic: ٱلْبَتْراء, romanized: Al-Batrāʾ; Ancient Greek:
        Πέτρα "Rock"), originally known to its
        inhabitants as Raqmu (Nabataean: 𐢛𐢚𐢒‎ or 𐢛𐢚𐢓𐢈‎, *Raqēmō),[3][4] is an ancient city and archaeological
        site in southern Jordan. Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit systems, Petra is also called
        the "Rose City" because of the colour of the sandstone from which it is carved.[5] The city is one of the New 7
        Wonders of the World and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum">Colosseum</a> (/ˌkɒləˈsiːəm/ KOL-ə-SEE-əm; Italian:
        Colosseo [kolosˈsɛːo], ultimately from Ancient Greek word
        "kolossos" meaning a large statue or giant) is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome,
        Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is the largest
        standing amphitheatre in the world. Construction began under the Emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in 72[1] and
        was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81).[2] Further modifications were made during
        the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96).[3] The three emperors who were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian
        dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian:
        Anfiteatro Flavio [aɱfiteˈaːtro ˈflaːvjo]) by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with
        their family name (Flavius).</p>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chichen_Itza">Chichén Itzá</a>[nb 1] (often spelled Chichen Itza in
        English and traditional Yucatec Maya) Yucatec Maya
        pronunciationⓘ was a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic period. The
        archeological site is located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico.[1]

        Chichén Itzá was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD 600–900) through
        the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900–1200). The
        site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc
        and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have
        been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most contemporary
        interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion.</p>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machu_Picchu">Machu Picchu</a>[a] is a 15th-century Inca citadel located
        in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru on a mountain
        ridge at 2,430 meters (7,970 ft). It is situated in the Machupicchu District of Urubamba Province[9] about 80
        kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cusco, above the Sacred Valley and along the Urubamba River, which forms a deep
        canyon with a subtropical mountain climate.[10]

        Often referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas",[11] Machu Picchu is one of the most iconic symbols of the
        Inca civilization and a major archaeological site in the Americas. Built around 1450, it is believed to have
        served as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti, though no contemporary written records exist to confirm
        this. The site was abandoned roughly a century later, likely during the Spanish conquest. Modern radiocarbon
        dating places its occupation between c. 1420 and 1530.[12]</p>

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_the_Redeemer_(statue)">Christ the Redeemer</a> (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian
    Portuguese: [ˈkɾistu ʁedẽˈtoʁ]) is an Art Deco statue of Jesus in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French-Polish
    sculptor Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer
    Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue
    is 30 metres (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide.[1][2] It
    is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone.[3][4][5] Christ the Redeemer differs considerably from its original
    design, as the initial plan was a large Christ with a globe in one hand and a cross in the other. Although the
    project organizers originally accepted the design, it later changed to the statue of today, with the arms spread out
    wide.
